A text document called milestone.txt with your name and the name of your partner (if any), 
the project that you've chosen, and a brief description of your plans for your game. 
One paragraph will suffice for the description. Also, include a description of the objective 
of the game—and how we should run it!

In addition, your document should give instructions for playing the game as it
currently operates, e.g. "Pressing the "s" key will do one thing, the mouse will 
allow the user to do another thing, etc."

Implementation of enough of the functions, with docstrings, that the game does something 
interesting (even if it is far short of the complete implementation) in a file called 
milestone.py—in fact, if your file is named something else, this is completely OK—just 
note how we should run it in your milestone.txt file.

Specifically, your program should include at least some "linear" collisions (a point 
object with a plane or a line) and at least some "spherical" collisions (a point object 
with another point object).

Include any other files needed to test your game, as well...all of these should be zipped 
into vpython_milestone.zip and submitted.
