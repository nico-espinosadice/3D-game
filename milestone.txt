Project: vPython 3D Game

Paragraph
The game involves the user controlling a character that is chasing after three runaway balls. The box travels through a track attempting to catch the three balls. The track itself is filled with obstacles and a speed boosting section. Collisions will include bouncing off the stationary walls and off the obstacles moving throughout the track. 

For the milestone submission, we have the basic structure of the track complete, including the walls and 
stationary obstacles. The milestone submission also contains the user-controlled character. The user controlled object 
operates in a similar way to the object from the vPython Lab.

We also have some of the moving obstacles, the “physics” of the collisions, and the “penalty” 
for running into certain obstacles. The moving objects appearing in different parts of the track pose challenges 
to the player, including collisions, potential penalties if the user touches object, speed boosts, and more. 
The three runaway balls move at different but constant velocities, which will allow us to change the 
difficulty of the game. (The runaway balls will only be affected by some of the objects on the track). Once 
the user-controlled character captures all three balls, they win the game. If they fail to do so in the alloted 
time, they lose. If possible, we will try to add curves to the track.
