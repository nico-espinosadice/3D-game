Paragraph
The game involves the user controlling a character that is chasing after three runaway spheres. These move at different speeds through the track. Based on which of these objects the user catches, points are awarded. If the user catches the first sphere, they receive one point. If they catch the second sphere, they receive two points. If they catch the third sphere, they receive three points. Once the user has captured all three runaway spheres, the game ends. The track contains obstacles and a speed boosting section. Collisions with the smaller white obstacles result in a loss of speed. Collisions with the large white box results in the user being fired off in a direction. When this happens, be sure to press the space bar quickly or risk being launched off the track! Additionally, there is a speed boost section.

To run the game, the user moves using the arrow keys, with each key corresponding to a direction in which the ball will move. If the spacebar is pressed, the overall velocity becomes about a half of what it was. This is good to use if moving around corners. Your goal is to catch all the runaway spheres moving around the track. If you catch them all before you run out of laps, you win the game.

# How To Play
Use the arrow keys to navigate through the track. Avoid the obstacles (white boxes) while trying to capture the runaway spheres. It is highly recommended that you use the space bar to slow down before turns. You have three laps to capture all the spheres. Good luck!
