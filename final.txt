# Game Description:
Somewhere between PacMan and MarioKart*

# Objective
Capture the runaway spheres!

# How To Play
Select a game difficulty by pressing 'e' for an easy game and 'h' for a hard game. (This will start the game. It is suggested you finish reading the instructions before starting the game.)
Use the arrow keys to move the ball in different directions. Hold a key down for an acceleration in that direction.
TIP: It is highly recommended to use the space bar to slow down before turns.
Also, avoid the obstacles!
Your goal is to catch all three of the other spheres within 3 laps

To use a grutor mode in order to check if the game ends, don't press any arrow keys except for the 
initial key so that you can wait for the chase objects/spheres to cycle around to you

# How To Win
Capture all three runaway spheres in three laps or less!

# How To Lose
Fail to capture the runaway spheres in three laps or less and you lose!
(Also, note that the runaway spheres keep track of their laps too. After three laps, they disappear.)

# Track Features and Further Information
The track features two sets of obstacles. The first group of obstacles are the small pink boxes. These small white boxes
make you lose all your speed, but they can be recovered from very quickly. The next obstacle is a big pink box. Beware of
this obstacle. Running into this one will make you spin out of control, and – if you do not press the space bar in time – 
could send you flying off the track.
The track also includes a "turbo-boost" section.
Finally, be sure not to fall off the track. This constitutes using a lap!

# Important Notes
While we tried our best to make the game as "cheat-proof" as possible, there are still possible ways in which to "cheat."
The most obvious way to "game the system" is to keep the ball in one spot and let the runaway spheres eventually catch up and 
run into you. This can be used as a grutor mode. Also, if you are traveling very fast, you may find that the ball gets "stuck" in walls. If this happens, hold down an arrow key to escape.
